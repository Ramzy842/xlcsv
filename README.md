## Awesome XLSX to CSV Converter

**What it is:** A user-friendly web application written in NextJS that converts your Excel (XLSX) files to a more manageable CSV format. It can handle single files, multiple files, entire folders, and even a combination of folders and files - all in one go!

**Why it's cool:**

-   **Drag-and-drop magic:** Simply drag your files (or folders) into the designated area, and the app does the rest.
-   **Batch conversions:** No need to convert files one by one. This app can handle a multitude of files simultaneously, saving you tons of time.
-   **Visual feedback:** A progress bar and loader keep you informed while the conversion is happening.
-   **Download flexibility:** Choose to download each converted CSV file individually, or have them all zipped together in a convenient package for easy storage.

**Getting Started:**

1.  **Open this web app in your browser.**
2.  **Drag and drop your XLSX files, folders containing XLSX files, or a combination of both into the designated area.**
3.  **Click the "Convert Files" button.**
4.  **Sit back and relax while the progress bar and loader keep you updated on the conversion.**

**Once converted:**

-   A list of your converted CSV files will appear.
-   You can download each file individually by clicking the corresponding "Download" button next to each file.
-   Alternatively, click the "Download All" button to get all the converted CSVs zipped into a single file for easy download.
