Awesome XLSX to CSV Converter [Consider adding an image icon here]
What it is:  A user-friendly web application written in [programming language(s) used] that converts your Excel (XLSX) files to a more manageable CSV format. It can handle single files, multiple files, entire folders, and even a combination of folders and files - all in one go!

Why it's cool:

Drag-and-drop magic: Simply drag your files (or folders) into the designated area, and the app does the rest.
Batch conversions: No need to convert files one by one. This app can handle a multitude of files simultaneously, saving you tons of time.
Visual feedback: A progress bar and loader keep you informed while the conversion is happening.
Download flexibility: Choose to download each converted CSV file individually, or have them all zipped together in a convenient package for easy storage.
Getting Started:

Open this web app in your browser.
Drag and drop your XLSX files, folders containing XLSX files, or a combination of both into the designated area.
Click the "Convert Files" button.
Sit back and relax while the progress bar and loader keep you updated on the conversion.
Once converted:

A list of your converted CSV files will appear.
You can download each file individually by clicking the corresponding "Download" button next to each file.
Alternatively, click the "Download All" button to get all the converted CSVs zipped into a single file for easy download.
